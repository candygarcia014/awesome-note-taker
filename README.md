# awesome-note-taker

## Description
This note taking app allows the user to create notes by adding a tittle and a body to the note. Once those fields are created the user can save the note and it will appear on the left column with other saved notes. The user can delete the notes by clicking the red trashcan to the right of the note tittle. The note will be deleted immediately.
